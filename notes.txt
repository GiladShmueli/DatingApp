postman 404 Unable to verify the first certificate (part 35)

dotnet dev-certs https --trust =>
Trusting the HTTPS development certificate was requested. A confirmation prompt will be displayed if the certificate was not previously trusted. Click yes on 
the prompt to trust the certificate.
A valid HTTPS certificate is already present.

solutions online kept saying disable SSL on Postman, or get the CER file for the CA Certificate.

tried several ideas till I forfeited to it, and used Neil's files. Was looking through the files to see the changes, but it was quite hard to follow.

//manually fixed the error.statusText

                // either that is the problem or the fact that we "solved" the issue.
                // a better way to handle this would be enum or something alike to keep it cleaner and clearer, 
                // or to find another way online, but I want to progress more.
